# Babble2Blog
> Speech to Blog Post Generator

This tool takes a speech input and drives it through OpenAPI's Whisper API to
transcribe the speech into text. The text is then fed into OpenAI's GPT-4 model
to generate a blog post.

## See an example!

This is a blog post generated by this tool:

https://thejunkland.com/blog/speech-to-blogpost.html

Note the original audio file that's also included in the blog post.

## Getting started

You can use the tool from command line.

```shell
yarn
yarn start speech-input.mp3 blog-post-output.md
```

This installs the project's dependencies and runs the tool against the given
input audio file `speech-input.mp3` and outputs the blog post to
`blog-post-output.md`.

### Prerequisites

You need an API key for OpenAI's Whisper API and GPT-4 API. You can get these by
registering at the [OpenAI's website](https://openai.com). Note that both
Whisper and GPT-4 are paid APIs (although they're super cheap).

Create a file called `.env` in the root of the project and add the following
line:

```
OPENAI_TOKEN=your-token-here
```

Alternatively, you can set the `OPENAI_TOKEN` environment variable.

## Features

This project aims to be a tool that:
* Makes it easy to generate blog posts when you don't have access to keyboard
* Demonstrates state-of-the-art AI capabilities (as of 2023)
* Makes my life easier

### About the logo

The logo of this project was created using DALLÂ·E, with the prompt:

> Icon for app that creates blog posts from speech, dribble, concept art, iOS

The [generated result](https://labs.openai.com/s/x8QFNJqeuQRnw0w0Y9HhvewP) was
then polished by hand with Inkscape.
